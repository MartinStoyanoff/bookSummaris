# Thinking, Fast and Slow

## Core Concept
- The mind has **two systems** of thinking:
  - **System 1:** Fast, intuitive, automatic
  - **System 2:** Slow, deliberate, analytical
- Much of our thinking is dominated by **System 1**, often leading to **biases and errors**

## System 1 vs. System 2

### System 1 (Fast Thinking)
- Quick, instinctive, emotional
- Operates automatically with little effort
- Used for everyday decisions, pattern recognition

### System 2 (Slow Thinking)
- Logical, effortful, deliberate
- Engaged for complex reasoning, problem-solving
- Requires attention and energy

## Key Cognitive Biases & Concepts

### 1. Anchoring
- Initial numbers or information **influence judgments**
- Even irrelevant anchors affect estimates

### 2. Availability Heuristic
- Judgments are based on **how easily examples come to mind**
- Leads to overestimating rare events (e.g. plane crashes)

### 3. Representativeness Heuristic
- Judging probability based on how much something **resembles** a stereotype
- Ignores base rates and statistical logic

### 4. Loss Aversion
- Losses hurt more than gains feel good
- People take irrational risks to avoid losses

### 5. Endowment Effect
- We **overvalue** what we already own
- Leads to reluctance in selling or letting go

### 6. Framing Effect
- Decisions are influenced by **how choices are presented**
- Same fact, different emotional impact depending on phrasing

### 7. Overconfidence
- People tend to be too confident in their judgments
- Experts are often wrong, yet very sure

### 8. Hindsight Bias
- Events seem **more predictable after they happen**
- Skews learning from experience

### 9. Planning Fallacy
- People underestimate the time and cost needed for tasks
- Even with past data, we stay optimistic

## Prospect Theory
- Replaces traditional economic "utility theory"
- People value **gains and losses** differently
- Risk-averse in gains, risk-seeking in losses

## Two Selves

### Experiencing Self
- Lives in the moment
- Feels pleasure and pain

### Remembering Self
- Constructs memories and stories
- **Makes decisions** based on how events are remembered, not experienced

## Final Message
- Human thinking is deeply flawed and biased
- Awareness of System 1 & 2 can improve decision-making
- Mastery of judgment requires humility and reflection
