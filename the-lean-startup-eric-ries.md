# The Lean Startup

## Core Philosophy
- Startups succeed by being **agile**, **data-driven**, and **customer-focused**
- Build products that meet real customer needs using a **scientific approach**
- Eliminate waste and speed up learning

## Key Concepts

### Build-Measure-Learn Loop
- **Build**: Create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- **Measure**: Collect real customer feedback
- **Learn**: Use insights to decide whether to pivot or persevere

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- The simplest version of a product that allows you to start learning
- Focus on testing core assumptions, not perfection
- Avoid overbuilding before validating

### Validated Learning
- Learning what customers **actually want**
- Based on data, not assumptions or opinions
- Each experiment teaches something actionable

### Innovation Accounting
- Track progress through learning, not vanity metrics
- Set baselines, tune the engine, and decide to pivot or persevere
- Metrics should inform decision-making

### Pivot vs. Persevere
- **Pivot**: Make a fundamental change to product, strategy, or target market
- **Persevere**: Continue on the current path if data supports it
- Pivot is not failure — it's learning in action

## Lean Startup Principles
